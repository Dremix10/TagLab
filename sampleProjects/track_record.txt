Model1:
-> used hand-labelled initial pic1 to train model1 (test_ds_1)
-> used model1 to label OVER pic1
-> labels were big and all over the place resulting to an overall fail

Model2:
-> used hand-labelled initial pic1 to train model2 (test_ds_2_vertical)
-> used model2 to label empty pic2
-> tree labelling failled but car labelling was very good
-> refined and cleaned labelling, leaving only cars (grouped cars labelled as 1)

Model3:
-> used refined labelled pic2 to train model3 (hd_ds_1_vertical)
-> used model3 to label empty pic3
-> car labelling was not that good with a lot of inaccuracies

Model4:
-> refined and labelled all cars of pic1 (some in groups)
-> used refined hand-labelled pic1 to train model4 (test_ds_3_vertical)
-> used model4 to label empty pic4
-> car labelling was fairly good but with inaccuracies
-> used model2 to label empty pic4
-> car labelling was better than model4 but trees messed it up

Model5:
-> refined pic4 model2 labelling and used that to train model5 (test_ds_4_vertical)
-> used models 2,4,5 to label empty pic1 (separately)
-> model 2 is better by far, only flaw is that it has trees aswell which messes it up
-> it seems that grouped cars worsen the model as model2 was trained on single cars only
-> used model 2 to label empty pic5
-> we can clearly see that labelling of single cars is very good with that model

Plan:
-> fix hand_labelled_pic1 to include no groups and train new model on that but with
more epochs/batch to replicate a better model2
-> use that to label many images and then create a large ds to train a new model
that will also include grouped cars but with alot more input data to see how that performs

Model6:
-> added (almost) all cars of pic1 hand-labelled without groups
-> used that to train model6 (beta_ds_1_v), v stands for vertical split
-> 


Picture Reference:
pic1 = 100_0001 - half resolution
pic2 = 100_0005 - full resolution
pic3 = 100_0018 - full resolution
pic4 = 100_0005 - half resolution
pic5 = 100_0018 - half resolution



Model Reference:
model1 (test_model_1) = 10 epoch/4 batch with all labels - took 5 minutes
			(bus, truck, car, person, tree, high tree)
model2 (test_model_2) = 50 epoch/4 batch with 2 labels - took 30 minutes
			(car, tree)
model3 (hd_model_1)   = 25 epoch/4 batch with 1 label - took 1 hour
			(car)
model4 (test_model_3) = 80 epoch/5 batch with 1 label - took 1 hour
			(car) - there were car groups
model5 (test_model_4) = 80 epoch/5 batch with 1 label - took 1 hour
			(car) - there were car groups
model6 (beta_model_1) = 80 epoch/5 batch with 1 label - took 
			(car)
