Model1:
-> used hand-labelled initial pic1 to train model1 (test_ds_1)
-> used model1 to label OVER pic1
-> labels were big and all over the place resulting to an overall fail

Model2:
-> used hand-labelled initial pic1 to train model2 (test_ds_2_vertical)
-> used model2 to label empty pic2
-> tree labelling failled but car labelling was very good
-> refined and cleaned labelling, leaving only cars (grouped cars labelled as 1)

Model3:
-> used refined labelled pic2 to train model3 (hd_ds_1_vertical)
-> used model3 to label empty pic3
-> car labelling was not that good with a lot of inaccuracies

Model4:
-> refined and labelled all cars of pic1 (some in groups)
-> used refined hand-labelled pic1 to train model4 (test_ds_3_vertical)
-> used model4 to label empty pic4
-> car labelling was fairly good but with inaccuracies
-> used model2 to label empty pic4
-> car labelling was better than model4 but trees messed it up

Model5:
-> refined pic4 model2 labelling and used that to train model5 (test_ds_4_vertical)
-> used models 2,4,5 to label empty pic1 (separately)
-> model 2 is better by far, only flaw is that it has trees aswell which messes it up
-> it seems that grouped cars worsen the model as model2 was trained on single cars only
-> used model 2 to label empty pic5
-> we can clearly see that labelling of single cars is very good with that model

Plan:
-> fix hand_labelled_pic1 to include no groups and train new model on that but with
more epochs/batch to replicate a better model2
-> use that to label many images and then create a large ds to train a new model
that will also include grouped cars but with alot more input data to see how that performs

Model6:
-> added (almost) all cars of pic1 hand-labelled without groups
-> used that to train model6 (beta_ds_1_v), v stands for vertical split
-> used model 6 to label empty pics 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
-> results at a glance look very promising, more detailed comparison/evaluation to be done
-> comparing pic 1, 4, 5 with models 2 and 6 we can see very similar results
-> both have slight inaccuracies, but are generally a very good starting point
-> refining/fixing to be done to all pictures labelled with model 6

Model7:
-> refined pic 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and included groups in them
-> used those pics to train model7 (big_ds_1)
-> used model 7 to label empty pic 1, 10
-> results look very disappointing
-> seeing how messed up the labelling is I believe that no-car-groups is the way to go

Model8:
-> fixed pic 1, 5, 7, 8, 9 to split all car-groups into single cars
-> used those pics to train model8 (big_ds_2)
->
